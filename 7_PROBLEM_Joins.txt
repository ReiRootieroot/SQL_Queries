-- Given the Students, StudentEnrollments, and Classrooms tables in 'Initial_Tables_Script.txt', solve the following problems.

-- PROBLEM 1
-- Get the FirstName, LastName, and average of all grades of each student.
SELECT s.StudentId, s.FirstName, s.LastName, AVG(se.Grade) AS 'Average Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se ON s.StudentId = se.StudentId
GROUP BY s.StudentId
-- Could also do:
-- GROUP BY s.FirstName, s.LastName

-- PROBLEM 2
-- What is the average of score of Donald Duck?
-- Answer: 80.2
SELECT s.FirstName, s.LastName, AVG(se.Grade) AS 'Average Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se ON s.StudentId = se.StudentId
WHERE FirstName = 'Donald' AND LastName = 'Duck';

-- PROBLEM 3
-- Which class of Mickey Mouse has the highest grade? (Give class name)
SELECT s.FirstName, s.LastName, c.ClassName, se.Grade
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se ON s.StudentId = se.StudentId
INNER JOIN Classrooms c ON se.ClassroomId = c.ClassroomId
WHERE FirstName = 'Mickey' AND LastName = 'Mouse'
ORDER BY se.Grade DESC
LIMIT 1

-- PROBLEM 4
-- Get the average score for each class. (Show class name and average score)
SELECT c.ClassName, AVG(se.Grade) AS 'Class Average'
FROM StudentEnrollments se
INNER JOIN Classrooms c ON se.ClassroomId = c.ClassroomId
GROUP BY c.ClassName

-- PROBLEM 5
-- Get the LastName, FirstName, ClassName and weighted grade (weight * grade) of each student.
SELECT s.LastName, s.FirstName, c.ClassName, (c.Weight * se.Grade) AS 'Weighted Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se ON s.StudentId = se.StudentId
INNER JOIN Classrooms c ON se.ClassroomId = c.ClassroomId

-- Orginally had: 
-- SELECT s.LastName, s.FirstName, c.ClassName, SUM (c.Weight * se.Grade) AS 'Weighted Grade'
-- GROUP BY s.StudentId
