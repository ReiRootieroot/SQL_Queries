-- Given the Students, StudentEnrollments, and Classrooms tables in 'Initial_Tables_Script.txt', solve the following problems.
-- THIS IS MY OWN PERSONAL CODE.

-- PROBLEM 1
-- How is the Duck family when it comes to Running?
SELECT FirstName, LastName, se.Grade AS 'Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se ON s.StudentId = se.StudentId
INNER JOIN 
(
	SELECT *
	FROM Classrooms c
	WHERE ClassName = 'Running'
) AS cTemp ON cTemp.ClassroomId = se.ClassroomId
WHERE LastName = 'Duck'
-- Can also do:
SELECT FirstName, LastName, se.Grade AS 'Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se ON s.StudentId = se.StudentId
INNER JOIN Classrooms c ON se.ClassroomId = c.ClassroomId
WHERE s.LastName = 'Duck' AND c.ClassName = 'Running'

-- PROBLEM 2
-- What are the averages of the Duck family?
SELECT FirstName, LastName, AVG(se.Grade) AS 'Average Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se ON s.StudentId = se.StudentId
INNER JOIN 
(
	SELECT *
	FROM Classrooms c
) AS cTemp ON cTemp.ClassroomId = se.ClassroomId
WHERE LastName = 'Duck'
GROUP BY s.StudentId
-- Can also do:
SELECT s.FirstName, s.LastName, AVG(se.Grade) as TotalGrade
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se ON s.StudentId = se.StudentId
WHERE s.LastName = 'Duck'
GROUP BY s.FirstName, s.LastName

-- PROBLEM 3
-- Are there any missing students in any of the classes? (Determine by counting attendance)
SELECT c.ClassName, COUNT(se.StudentId) AS 'Attendance Count'
FROM StudentEnrollments se
INNER JOIN Classrooms c ON c.ClassroomId = se.ClassroomId
GROUP BY se.ClassroomId

-- PROBLEM 4
-- List students born in the month of November.
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Students
WHERE DateOfBirth LIKE '____-12%';
