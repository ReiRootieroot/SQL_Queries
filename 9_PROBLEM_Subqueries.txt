-- Given the Students, StudentEnrollments, and Classrooms tables in 'Initial_Tables_Script.txt', solve the following problems.

-- PROBLEM 1
-- What is the final grade of Donald Duck? To compute, sum all weight * grade of each class
SELECT tmp1.StudentId, SUM(tmp2.Weight * Grade) AS 'Final Grade'
FROM StudentEnrollments se
INNER JOIN
(	SELECT StudentId
	FROM Students
	WHERE FirstName = 'Donald' AND LastName = 'Duck'
) AS tmp1 ON tmp1.StudentId = se.StudentId
INNER JOIN
( 	SELECT ClassroomId, Weight
	FROM Classrooms
) AS tmp2 ON tmp2.ClassroomId = se.ClassroomId
-- Simplified version given:
SELECT SUM(c.Weight * se.Grade) AS 'Final Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se AS s.StudentId = se.StudentId
INNER JOIN Classrooms c AS se.ClassroomId = c.ClassroomId
WHERE FirstName = 'Donald' AND LastName = 'LastName'

-- PROBLEM 2
-- What is the final grade of all students? Show FirstName, LastName, and final grade.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, SUM(tmp2.Weight * tmp1.Grade) AS 'Final Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN
(	SELECT *
	FROM StudentEnrollments
) AS tmp1 ON tmp1.StudentId = s.StudentId
INNER JOIN
( 	SELECT ClassroomId, Weight
	FROM Classrooms
) AS tmp2 ON tmp2.ClassroomId = tmp1.ClassroomId

-- Simplified version given:
SELECT FirstName, LastName, SUM(c.Weight * se.Grade) AS 'Final Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN StudentEnrollments se AS s.StudentId = se.StudentId
INNER JOIN Classrooms c AS se.ClassroomId = c.ClassroomId
GROUP BY s.StudentId

-- PROBLEM 3
-- Get average grade of each student for Running and Acting classes. Show FirstName, LastName, and average grade of the 2 classes.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, AVG(Grade) AS 'Average Grade'
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN
(	SELECT *
	FROM StudentEnrollments
) AS tmp1 ON tmp1.StudentId = s.StudentId
INNER JOIN
( 	SELECT ClassroomId, Weight
	FROM Classrooms
	WHERE ClassName IN ('Running', 'Acting')
) AS tmp2 ON tmp2.ClassroomId = tmp1.ClassroomId
